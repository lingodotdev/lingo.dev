I started using your product in my big client project  from really love the way you handled Brand-aware ai-translations , it’s solid. 
But I noticed it’s missing a few key things like multi-agent translation review system where ai agents do the first pass and internal users / translators can quickly review and refine. 
And uploading short videos / UX flows instead of just screenshots.

That’s making it hard for me to move forward and feel confident I’ll be successful with it. 

Any idea when you might be adding those features?
