# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The File Watching & Auto-retranslation feature enables real-time monitoring of translation source files and automatically triggers retranslation when changes are detected. This hot reload functionality provides developers with immediate feedback during the translation development process, similar to how modern development servers automatically refresh when code changes are made.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with translations, I want the system to automatically detect when I modify translation source files, so that I can see updated translations immediately without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a translation source file is modified THEN the system SHALL detect the change within 500ms
2. WHEN a file change is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger an automatic retranslation process
3. WHEN multiple files are changed in quick succession THEN the system SHALL debounce the retranslation to avoid excessive processing
4. IF a file is temporarily locked or being written THEN the system SHALL wait for the file to be fully written before processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure which files and directories are watched for changes, so that I can control the scope of automatic retranslation and avoid unnecessary processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the file watcher is initialized THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of watched file patterns
2. WHEN a configuration specifies include patterns THEN the system SHALL only watch files matching those patterns
3. WHEN a configuration specifies exclude patterns THEN the system SHALL ignore files matching those patterns
4. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for common translation file formats
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL update the watched files without requiring a restart

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive real-time feedback about the retranslation process, so that I can understand what's happening and identify any issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file change is detected THEN the system SHALL log the detected file and change type
2. WHEN retranslation starts THEN the system SHALL indicate which files are being processed
3. WHEN retranslation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL report the completion status and processing time
4. IF retranslation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable information
5. WHEN multiple files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file watcher to handle different types of file operations gracefully, so that the system remains stable during various development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is created THEN the system SHALL detect it and include it in retranslation if it matches watch patterns
2. WHEN a file is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from the translation cache and update dependent translations
3. WHEN a file is renamed or moved THEN the system SHALL handle the old and new paths appropriately
4. WHEN a directory is added or removed THEN the system SHALL update the watch list accordingly
5. IF the watched directory becomes temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to start and stop the file watching functionality, so that I can control when automatic retranslation is active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the watch command is executed THEN the system SHALL start monitoring configured files and directories
2. WHEN the watch process is stopped THEN the system SHALL cleanly shut down file watchers and release resources
3. WHEN the system receives a termination signal THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop all watchers before exiting
4. IF the watch process encounters a fatal error THEN the system SHALL log the error and exit cleanly
5. WHEN the watch process is running THEN the system SHALL provide a way to check its status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working in a team environment, I want the file watcher to work efficiently with version control systems, so that it doesn't interfere with git operations or cause performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN git operations modify multiple files THEN the system SHALL batch process the changes efficiently
2. WHEN .git directory contents change THEN the system SHALL ignore these changes
3. WHEN temporary files are created by editors THEN the system SHALL ignore files matching common temporary file patterns
4. IF a large number of files change simultaneously THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent system overload
5. WHEN branch switching occurs THEN the system SHALL detect the bulk changes and handle them appropriately
