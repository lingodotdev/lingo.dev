üåç Lingo.dev CLI + Flutter Integration Guide



Learn how to integrate Lingo.dev CLI into your Flutter app to manage multilingual content effortlessly ‚Äî from setup to live translations.



Overview



In this guide, you‚Äôll set up Lingo.dev CLI in a Flutter project to:



Manage your localization files in one place.



Automatically sync translations from Lingo.dev.



Dynamically switch between languages in your app.



You‚Äôll go from a clean Flutter app to a fully localized one ‚Äî step by step.



Prerequisites



Before you begin, make sure you have:



Flutter

&nbsp;‚â• 3.0 installed



Lingo.dev account



Lingo.dev CLI

&nbsp;installed



npm install -g @lingo.dev/cli





A working Flutter project (or create one with):



flutter create lingo\_flutter\_demo

cd lingo\_flutter\_demo



Step 1 ‚Äì Enable localization in Flutter



First, configure your app to support localization.



Open your pubspec.yaml and add:



dependencies:

&nbsp; flutter\_localizations:

&nbsp;   sdk: flutter

&nbsp; intl: any





Then, in lib/main.dart, add localization support:



import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:flutter\_localizations/flutter\_localizations.dart';

import 'generated/l10n.dart';



void main() {

&nbsp; runApp(const MyApp());

}



class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

&nbsp; const MyApp({super.key});



&nbsp; @override

&nbsp; Widget build(BuildContext context) {

&nbsp;   return MaterialApp(

&nbsp;     title: 'Lingo Flutter Demo',

&nbsp;     localizationsDelegates: const \[

&nbsp;       S.delegate,

&nbsp;       GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,

&nbsp;       GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,

&nbsp;       GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,

&nbsp;     ],

&nbsp;     supportedLocales: S.delegate.supportedLocales,

&nbsp;     home: const MyHomePage(),

&nbsp;   );

&nbsp; }

}



class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {

&nbsp; const MyHomePage({super.key});



&nbsp; @override

&nbsp; Widget build(BuildContext context) {

&nbsp;   return Scaffold(

&nbsp;     appBar: AppBar(title: Text(S.of(context).helloWorld)),

&nbsp;     body: Center(child: Text(S.of(context).welcomeMessage)),

&nbsp;   );

&nbsp; }

}



Step 2 ‚Äì Initialize Lingo.dev



Connect your project to Lingo.dev:



lingo init





This command will:



Ask you to log in to your Lingo.dev account.



Create a lingo.config.json file.



Link your project to a workspace and project in Lingo.dev.



Example lingo.config.json:



{

&nbsp; "projectId": "your-lingo-project-id",

&nbsp; "output": "lib/l10n",

&nbsp; "format": "arb"

}



Step 3 ‚Äì Pull translations from Lingo.dev



To fetch your translations:



lingo pull





This downloads your translation files (e.g., app\_en.arb, app\_es.arb) into lib/l10n/.



Example output:



‚úî Pulled 2 languages: en, es

‚úî Updated: lib/l10n/app\_en.arb

‚úî Updated: lib/l10n/app\_es.arb



Step 4 ‚Äì Generate localization classes



Flutter uses code generation for localization.

Run:



flutter gen-l10n





This creates a generated/l10n.dart file, giving you a strongly typed S class to access your strings.



Example:



Text(S.of(context).welcomeMessage)



Step 5 ‚Äì Edit translations in Lingo.dev



Open your project dashboard on Lingo.dev

.



Add or edit your strings (keys like helloWorld or welcomeMessage).



Whenever you update translations, run:



lingo pull

flutter gen-l10n





to sync them back into your app.



Step 6 ‚Äì Switch languages at runtime



You can easily change the app language dynamically:



Locale newLocale = const Locale('es');

S.load(newLocale);





Or add a simple dropdown:



DropdownButton<Locale>(

&nbsp; value: S.delegate.supportedLocales.first,

&nbsp; items: S.delegate.supportedLocales

&nbsp;     .map((locale) => DropdownMenuItem(

&nbsp;           value: locale,

&nbsp;           child: Text(locale.languageCode),

&nbsp;         ))

&nbsp;     .toList(),

&nbsp; onChanged: (locale) {

&nbsp;   if (locale != null) {

&nbsp;     S.load(locale);

&nbsp;   }

&nbsp; },

)



Step 7 ‚Äì Push new keys to Lingo.dev



When you add new strings locally, push them to your Lingo.dev project:



lingo push





This uploads new keys from your .arb files so translators can work on them online.



Step 8 ‚Äì Build and run



Now build your app:



flutter run





You should see your localized texts rendered according to your device‚Äôs language settings.

Try changing your system language or switching locales manually.



Example Project



You can find a working example on GitHub:

üëâ github.com/lingo-dev/flutter-demo



Troubleshooting

Issue	Solution

S.of(context) returns null	Ensure MaterialApp has the localization delegates.

Missing translation key	Run flutter gen-l10n after updating .arb files.

CLI not recognized	Check your global npm path or reinstall with npm install -g @lingo.dev/cli.

Summary



‚úÖ You now have a fully working multilingual Flutter app powered by Lingo.dev.

You can push, pull, and manage translations with a single command ‚Äî all while keeping your code clean and synced.
