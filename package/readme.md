Replexica is a localization engine for React, to ship multi-lingual apps fast and reach more users.

Replexica supports React apps, and several i18n formats, including JSON-free, experimental Replexica Compiler format, `.md` files for Markdown content, and classic JSON and YAML-based formats.

Replexica comes with an open-source compiler plugin for React (experimental), and an i18n API in the cloud that performs translations using context-aware LLMs.
