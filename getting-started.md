# Getting Started

As mentioned in the [README](/readme.md), today Replexica works incredibly well only with Nextjs (App Router).

While we're working hard to make it work with other frameworks, let's see how to get started with Nextjs!

> [!TIP]
> Before applying Replexica to your project, we recommend finishing the tutorial, to learn the basics.

## Installation

First, let's create a brand new Nextjs project (be sure to choose app router when prompted):

```bash
pnpm create next-app replexica-demo
cd replexica-demo
```

Then, let's install Replexica:

```bash
pnpm add replexica @replexica/react @replexica/compiler
```

Lastly, let's login to Replexica API:

```bash
pnpm replexica auth --login
```

## Configuration

Now, let's update the content of the `next.config.mjs` file to enable Replexica compiler:

```js
// next.config.mjs

import replexica from '@replexica/compiler';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

/** @type {import('@replexica/compiler').ReplexicaConfig} */
const replexicaConfig = {
  locale: {
    source: 'en',
    targets: ['es'],
  },
};

export default replexica.next(
  replexicaConfig,
  nextConfig,
);

```

## Build

If you haven't already, authenticate with the Replexica platform:

```bash
pnpm replexica auth --login
```

Now, let's perform the initial build of our app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Next, let's process the translations using the Replexica API:

```bash
pnpm replexica i18n
```

Now, let's build the app again, to inject translations into the build output (Sorry for the double build, we're working on it! üôè):

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Finally, let's start the app:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

## Test

Now, let's test the app by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You should see the app in English, at first. To quickly check that everything works, run the following code in your browser's console:

```js
document.cookie = "REPLEXICA_LOCALE=es; path=/;";
location.reload();
```

... and you should see the app in Spanish!

To switch back to English, run:

```js
document.cookie = "REPLEXICA_LOCALE=en; path=/;";
location.reload();
```

In the real-world scenario, you would use a language switcher to change the locale. If you need advice on how to implement it fast - send us a message in the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GeK6AuSqzw), and we will help!

## Bonus: `use client` components

If you plan on having `'use client'` components *at least somewhere* in your app, you'll need to also wrap your entire component tree in `<ReplexicaProvider />`.

Replace the content of the `src/app/layout.tsx` file with the following:

```tsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";
import { ReplexicaIntlProvider } from '@replexica/react/client';
import { loadLocaleFromCookie } from '@replexica/react/next';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  const locale = await loadLocaleFromCookie();
  // Note the .client.json suffix of the i18n file below.
  // It means that only the values *actually used* get passed to the client, not the entire i18n dictionary.
  const localeData = await import(`@replexica/translations/${locale}.client.json`).then((m) => m.default);
  return (
    <ReplexicaIntlProvider data={localeData}>
      <html lang={locale}>
        <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ReplexicaIntlProvider>
  );
}
```

To test the `use client` components, let's create a new route. First, create a new file `src/app/client/page.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx
export { default } from './content';
```

Then, create a new file `src/app/client/content.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx
'use client';

export default function Content() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello from <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client"> client component</a>!
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you see, there is a `'use client'` directive at the top of the file. As a reminder, that means this particular component will be rendered on the client-side only, and the server will not see it, which is exactly what we want for this example.

Now, let's rebuild the app and fetch missing translations from our LLM-powered Replexica API:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm replexica i18n
pnpm run build
```

Finally, let's start the app again:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

Now, visit [http://localhost:3000/client](http://localhost:3000/client) in your browser. You should see the `use client` content!

Run the following code in your browser's console to switch the locale to Spanish:

```js
document.cookie = "REPLEXICA_LOCALE=es; path=/;";
location.reload();
```

and the following code to switch back to English:

```js
document.cookie = "REPLEXICA_LOCALE=en; path=/;";
location.reload();
```

## How to Switch Between Languages

Different apps use different strategies for switching between supported languages. Here are a few approaches we've seen:

* Cookie value (get/set cookie value)
* Subdomain (`en.myapp.com` / `es.myapp.com`)
* TLD domain (`myapp.com` / `myapp.es`)
* Pathname segments (`myapp.com/en` / `myapp.com/es`)

... and so on.

To support every possible strategy, now and in the future, Replexica does the following:

*Replexica reads the value of the `REPLEXICA_LOCALE` cookie to determine the currently selected locale*

So, whatever approach you choose for switching between locales, just be sure to update the value of the `REPLEXICA_LOCALE` cookie, and Replexica will handle the rest.

> [!WARNING]
> Be sure to drop by our Discord (link at the bottom) if you have an opinion on how Replexica should be handling the locale detection. Even if your idea is exotic or feels unfeasible, we'd love to hear it! üôè (feel free to send in private, if you want).

## Conclusion

That's it! You've successfully set up Replexica with Nextjs!

Now that you've completed the tutorial, you can start applying Replexica to your own projects.
