- **File system events**: Add, change, delete, rename operations
- **Debouncing**: Multiple strategies tested
- **Long-running stability**: Extended operation testing

## Test Infrastructure

### Mocking Strategy

- **External dependencies**: Plan, execute, and UI modules mocked
- **File system**: Chokidar mocked for predictable testing
- **Temporary directories**: Isolated test environments
- **Process cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup after tests

### Test Data
