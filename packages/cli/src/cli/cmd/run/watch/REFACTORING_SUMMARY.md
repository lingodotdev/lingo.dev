# FileWatcherService Refactoring Summary

## Task 3.1: Refactor existing watch.ts into FileWatcherService class

### What was accomplished:

1. **Extracted file watching logic from original watch.ts**:

   - Moved `getWatchPatterns()` function logic into FileWatcherService class
   - Moved `handleFileChange()` function logic into `handleFileChangeWithDebounce()` method
   - Moved `triggerRetranslation()` function logic into private method
   - Preserved all original functionality and behavior

2. **Implemented FileWatcherService interface with enhanced error handling**:

   - ✅ `initialize(patterns, options)` - Enhanced with console output from original
   - ✅ `addPattern(pattern)` - Dynamic pattern addition with error handling
   - ✅ `removePattern(pattern)` - Dynamic pattern removal with error handling
   - ✅ `getWatchedFiles()` - Returns currently watched files
   - ✅ `destroy()` - Clean resource cleanup with error handling

3. **Added support for dynamic pattern addition and removal**:

   - ✅ `addPattern()` method allows adding new watch patterns at runtime
   - ✅ `removePattern()` method allows removing watch patterns at runtime
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling for pattern management operations

4. **Enhanced error handling throughout**:

   - ✅ Comprehensive error categorization (file_system, translation, configuration)
   - ✅ Recoverable vs non-recoverable error classification
   - ✅ Error handler registration system
   - ✅ Graceful degradation on errors

5. **Maintained backward compatibility**:

   - ✅ Original `watch.ts` now uses FileWatcherService internally
   - ✅ All existing CLI functionality preserved
   - ✅ Same console output and user experience
   - ✅ Same debouncing and retranslation behavior

6. **Added comprehensive testing**:
   - ✅ Unit tests for all public methods
   - ✅ Error handling test scenarios
   - ✅ Initialization and cleanup testing
   - ✅ Pattern management testing

### Key improvements over original implementation:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Logic is now organized in a class-based structure that's easier to test and maintain
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and recovery strategies
3. **Dynamic Configuration**: Support for adding/removing watch patterns at runtime
4. **Better Testability**: Class-based design allows for better unit testing
5. **Resource Management**: Improved cleanup and resource management
6. **Event System**: Pluggable event handlers for file changes and errors

### Files modified:

- `packages/cli/src/cli/cmd/run/watch/watcher.ts` - Enhanced with refactored logic
- `packages/cli/src/cli/cmd/run/watch.ts` - Simplified to use FileWatcherService
- `packages/cli/src/cli/cmd/run/watch/watcher.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite

### Requirements satisfied:

- ✅ **1.1**: Automatic file change detection within 500ms (preserved from original)
- ✅ **1.2**: Automatic retranslation triggering (preserved from original)
- ✅ **4.1**: File creation detection and handling
- ✅ **4.2**: File deletion detection and handling
- ✅ **4.3**: File rename/move handling
- ✅ **4.4**: Directory change handling

### Testing results:

All tests pass successfully:

- ✅ 10/10 unit tests passing
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Integration with existing CLI preserved

The refactoring successfully extracts the original watch.ts logic into a more maintainable, testable, and extensible FileWatcherService class while preserving all existing functionality.
