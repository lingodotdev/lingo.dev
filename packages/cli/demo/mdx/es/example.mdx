# This heading text is localized

This paragraph text is localized and demonstrates how regular markdown content gets processed for localization.

## Text content is localized

All regular text content in MDX files is localized (except for **attribute values such as `alt`, `title`, or JSX props**, which stay exactly as they are), including:

- This list item text is localized
- **This bold text is also localized**
- *This italic text is localized too*

### Links and emphasis

[This link text is localized](https://example.com) and contains localized content.

> This blockquote text is localized

## Code blocks are not localized

```javascript
// This code comment is not localized
const message = "This string in code block is not localized";
function example() {
  return "Code content is preserved as-is";
}
````

```python
# This Python comment is not localized
def hello():
    return "This string is not localized"
```

## Inline code is not localized

This paragraph contains `inline code that is not localized` and shows how inline code spans are preserved.

You can use `const variable = "not localized"` in your code examples without worrying about localization.

## Mixed content example

Here's a paragraph that mixes localizable and non-localizable content:

This text is localized, but `this.code.snippet = "is not localized"`, while this continuation text is localized again.

## Tables with mixed content

| Column Header (localized)   | Code Column                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| This cell text is localized | `code.value = "not localized"`           |
| Another localized cell      | `function() { return "not localized"; }` |

## Attributes that are **not** localized

Below are examples of strings **not** sent for translation because they sit in element attributes (like the `alt` or `title` on an image or link) rather than in the visible body text:

![Alt text NOT localized](./logo.png "title attribute NOT localized")

[Link with title](https://example.com "this title attribute is NOT localized")

## JSX / raw HTML example

<Callout type="note">This JSX child text **is** localized</Callout>

The text inside the JSX element above is localized, **but** the `type="note"` prop value stays the same because attribute values are not processed by the loader.
