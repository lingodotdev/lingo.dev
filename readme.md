# Replexica

Replexica is a free, open-source compiler plugin for React, paired with an AI translation platform. It's a toolset that enables React apps to speak many languages.

[![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/replexica/replexica)](https://github.com/replexica/replexica/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
[![Release](https://github.com/replexica/replexica/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/replexica/replexica/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Why does this matter? Because 75% of the world doesn't speak English. If the app is multilingual, it can serve many more users. But, let's be honest, making an app multilingual is a headache: extract strings to JSON files, update translations every time something changes, etc.

That's where Replexica comes in: it's a build system plugin (+ AI engine in the cloud) that translates React apps into multiple languages. The best part - it doesn't require messing around with extracting or maintaining JSON files!

## API

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is for Next.js App Router apps only. Support for other setups is coming soon (ETA April 2024). <https://github.com/replexica/replexica/issues/25>

```js
// next.config.mjs

import compiler from '@replexica/compiler';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

/** @type {import('@replexica/compiler').ReplexicaConfig} */
const replexicaConfig = {
  locale: {
    source: 'en',
    targets: ['es'],
  },
};

export default compiler.next(
  replexicaConfig,
  nextConfig,
);

```

## Roadmap

The Replexica compiler is open-source, and the platform API is open, allowing you to build your own translation engine.

We're also developing our own i18n engine called [Replexica Cloud](https://replexica.com), to make it even easier to ship your first multi-language app!

## How it Works

Replexica is a compiler plugin that integrates with the build system, collecting all user-facing text in the app and preparing it for translation with the Replexica platform. Here's how it works:

1. **Infers** metadata from your app, such as the text that needs to be translated and its context. This metadata is then stored alongside the build artifacts.
1. **Translates** the text using the CLI that connects to the Replexica Cloud. The cloud engine uses AI to translate the text, and the more you use it, the better it gets. The API is open, so you can build your own translation engine if you wish!
1. **Injects** the translations back into your app, so that the translated text is displayed to the user, based on their locale.

With Replexica, you can build multi-language apps without the hassle of managing JSON files, and with the power of AI translation.

## The Replexica Rule

At Replexica, we believe in the elegance of [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) principle.

Therefore, there's an important rule to remember when using Replexica:

> [!TIP]
> Place translatable text inside `JSX`.

As long as you follow this rule, the Replexica Compiler can automatically infer the metadata from your app and prepare the text inside JSX for translation.

If you don't follow the rule and decide to store some of your translatable content in variables, that **can be translated too**, but you'll need to manually wrap that text in a helper function.

So, if you want a hassle-free i18n on autopilot, **follow The Replexica Rule** whenever possible.

### But what if I have an array of items, and some of the fields should be translated?

There's a common scenario, when you have an array of items that you render in a list, like this:

```jsx
const menuItems = [
  {
    title: 'Home',
    url: '/',
  },
  {
    title: 'About',
    url: '/about',
  },
  {
    title: 'Contact',
    url: '/contact',
  },
];
```

In this case, you can still follow The Replexica Rule by simply wrapping the text in JSX! Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
const menuItesm = [
  {
    title: <>Home</>,
    url: '/',
  },
  {
    title: <>About</>,
    url: '/about',
  },
  {
    title: <>Contact</>,
    url: '/contact',
  },
];
```

And that's it! The Replexica Compiler will automatically infer the metadata from the JSX and prepare the text for translation.

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Install Replexica

```bash
pnpm add replexica @replexica/compiler @replexica/react
```

### Step 2. Configure NextJS

```js
// next.config.mjs

import replexica from '@replexica/compiler';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

/** @type {import('@replexica/compiler').ReplexicaConfig} */
const replexicaConfig = {
  locale: {
    source: 'en', // Language the app's content is in
    targets: ['es'], // Target language(s)
  },
};

export default replexica.next(
  replexicaConfig,
  nextConfig,
);

```

### Step 3. Configure React app

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is for Next.js App Router apps only. Guides for other setups are coming soon (ETA April 2024). <https://github.com/replexica/replexica/issues/25>

If you plan on having `'use client'` components *at least somewhere* in your app (you probably do), you'll need to also wrap your entire component tree in `<ReplexicaProvider />`:

```jsx
// src/app/layout.tsx

import { ReplexicaIntlProvider } from '@replexica/react/client';
import { loadLocaleFromCookie } from '@replexica/react/next';

// ... rest of the code

export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  const locale = await loadLocaleFromCookie();
  // Note the .client.json suffix of the i18n file below.
  // It means that only the values *actually used* get passed to the client, not the entire i18n dictionary.
  const localeData = await import(`@replexica/translations/${locale}.client.json`).then((m) => m.default);
  return (
    <ReplexicaIntlProvider data={localeData}>
      <html lang={locale}>
        <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ReplexicaIntlProvider>
  );
}

```

### Step 4. Run the compiler

```bash
# If you haven't already, authenticate with the Replexica platform
pnpm replexica auth

# Build the app, without translations
pnpm run build

# Fetch translations from the Replexica platform
pnpm replexica i18n

# Build the app again, to inject translations into the build output
pnpm run build

# Start the app
pnpm run start
```

> [!TIP]
> `pnpm replexica i18n` must be run after every build, to fetch the latest translations from the Replexica platform. It must be run in CI/CD pipelines as well, right after the `build` step.

> [!NOTE]
> We know that running `pnpm replexica i18n` after every build and running the build twice can be a bit cumbersome. We're working on a solution to make this process more streamlined (ETA April 2024 üôè)! <https://github.com/replexica/replexica/issues/26>

### Step 5 (Optional). Test the result

If you haven't yet implemented the language switcher on the UI, run the following code in the browser console to switch the language to Spanish:

```js
document.cookie = "REPLEXICA_LOCALE=es; path=/;";
location.reload();
```

... and you should see the app in Spanish!

To switch back to English, run:

```js
document.cookie = "REPLEXICA_LOCALE=en; path=/;";
location.reload();
```

## How to Switch Between Languages

Different apps use different strategies for switching between supported languages. Here are a few approaches we've seen:

- Cookie value (get/set cookie value)
- Subdomain (`en.myapp.com` / `es.myapp.com`)
- TLD domain (`myapp.com` / `myapp.es`)
- Pathname segments (`myapp.com/en` / `myapp.com/es`)

... and so on.

To support every possible strategy, now and in the future, Replexica does the following:

*Replexica reads the value of the `REPLEXICA_LOCALE` cookie to determine the currently selected locale*

So, whatever approach you choose for switching between locales, just be sure to update the value of the `REPLEXICA_LOCALE` cookie, and Replexica will handle the rest.
