Replexica is an i18n platform for React, to ship multi-language apps fast.

Replexica supports React apps, and several i18n formats, including JSON-free, experimental Replexica Compiler format, `.md` files for Markdown content, and classic JSON and YAML-based formats.

Replexica comes with an open-source compiler plugin for React (experimental), and an i18n API in the cloud that performs translations using context-aware LLMs.

## Getting Started

Check out our [Docs](https://replexica.com/docs) for more detailed guides on how to use Replexica with your app.

## What's under the hood

Replexica is a full-stack LLM-powered i18n platform for React, and it consists of **two main parts**:

1. **Replexica i18n Compiler** (this repo, experimental) - an open-source compiler plugin for React:
    * Doesn't require extracting strings into JSON files;
    * Seamlessly integrates with React build system;
    * Infers metadata and user-facing text from the app;
    * Prepares the content for further context-aware translation.

1. **Replexica i18n API** ([replexica.com](https://replexica.com)) - an i18n API in the cloud that translates apps into multiple languages, using LLMs, fast:
    * $0/mo + usage-based API;
    * Full context awareness + brand voice;
    * State-of-the-art quality translations via a mix of open-source and proprietary AI models.

The core idea behind Replexica is simple: apps must be multi-language by default, from day one.

**The Internet is global, and so must be any software that runs on it.**
