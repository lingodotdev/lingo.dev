Replexica is an i18n compiler for React. It doesn't require extracting text into JSON files, and allows shipping multi-language apps fast, using an AI-powered API.

It comes in two parts:

1. **Replexica Compiler** - an open-source compiler plugin for React;
1. **Replexica API** - an i18n API in the cloud that performs translations using LLMs. (Usage based, has a free tier.)

Replexica supports several i18n formats:

1. JSON-free Replexica compiler format;
1. `.md` files for Markdown content;
1. Legacy JSON and YAML-based formats.

## Why

Having built tens of side-projects / micro-startups over the years, we found one thing to be particularly annoying: adding i18n to the app. We wanted to **ship, and ship fast**, not to mess with JSON files or extraction scripts.

So it got us thinking: why not build a tool that makes multi-language apps simpler? I mean, anyone who's tried to add i18n to their project knows it's a headache.

And after we found out [~80%](https://www.statista.com/chart/26884/languages-on-the-internet/#:~:text=The%201.46%20billion%20people%20who%20speak%20English%20still%20make%20up%20less%20than%2020%20percent%20of%20the%20world%20population) aren't fluent in English - that seemed like a missed opportunity, since i18n could be a shortcut to reaching more users, if only it was easier.

That's why we teamed up build a React compiler coupled with an AI-powered API, to make i18n as simple as possible, at the most fundamental level.

## Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is for Next.js App Router apps only. Support for other setups is coming soon (ETA April 2024). <https://github.com/replexica/replexica/issues/25>

To give a general idea behind Replexica, here's **the only change that's needed** to the basic Next.js app to make it multi-language:

```js
// next.config.mjs

// Import Replexica Compiler
import replexica from '@replexica/compiler';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

// Define Replexica configuration
/** @type {import('@replexica/compiler').ReplexicaConfig} */
const replexicaConfig = {
  locale: {
    source: 'en',
    targets: ['es'],
  },
};

// Wrap Next.js config with Replexica Compiler
export default replexica.next(
  replexicaConfig,
  nextConfig,
);

```

## Getting Started

We've prepared a [Getting Started](/getting-started.md) guide that walks you through the process of setting up Replexica Compiler with Next.js App Router. Check it out!

## What's under the hood

Replexica is a full-stack LLM-powered i18n tool for React, and it consists of **two main parts**:

1. **Replexica i18n Compiler** (this repo) - an open-source compiler plugin for React:
    * Doesn't require extracting strings into JSON files;
    * Seamlessly integrates with React build system;
    * Infers metadata and user-facing text from the app;
    * Prepares the content for further context-aware translation.

    The compiler hooks into the build process, infers metadata from the app, such as the text that needs to be translated and the context it's in. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is traversed to gather the metadata, the context, and the text that needs to be translated. This metadata is then stored alongside the build artifacts.

1. **Replexica i18n API** ([replexica.com](https://replexica.com)) - an i18n API in the cloud that translates apps into multiple languages, using LLMs, fast:
    * ~~$0/mo + usage, with free tier;~~ Entirely free, during the launch period;
    * Full context awareness + brand voice;
    * State-of-the-art quality translations (adding more new languages soon!) via a mix of open-source and proprietary AI models;
    * API is open, so anyone could build their own translation engine (self-hosting guide coming soon).

    The i18n engine uses AI to translate the text, and the more it's used, the better it gets. The very first version used plain gpt-3.5, though currently it's more like a mix of Llama + Google Vertex AI + GPT + Mixtral, and we're switching between models regularly as we improve the API.

The core idea behind Replexica is simple: apps must be multi-language by default, from day one. **The Internet is global, and so must be any software that runs on it.**

## The Replexica Rule

At Replexica, we believe in the elegance of [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) principle.

Therefore, there's one important rule to remember when using Replexica:

**Always put translatable text inside `JSX`.**

**As long as you follow this rule**, the Replexica Compiler **will** automatically infer the metadata from your app and prepare the text inside JSX for translation.

**If you don't follow the rule** and decide to store some of your translatable content in variables, that **can** be translated too, but you'll need to manually wrap that text in a helper function.

So, if you want a hassle-free i18n on autopilot, **follow The Replexica Rule** whenever possible.

### Dynamic content

There's a common scenario, when you have an array of items that you render in a list:

```jsx
const menuItems = [
  {
    title: 'Home',
    url: '/',
  },
  {
    title: 'About',
    url: '/about',
  },
  {
    title: 'Contact',
    url: '/contact',
  },
];
```

In this case, you can still follow The Replexica Rule by simply wrapping the text in JSX! Here's how:

```jsx
const menuItesm = [
  {
    title: <>Home</>,
    url: '/',
  },
  {
    title: <>About</>,
    url: '/about',
  },
  {
    title: <>Contact</>,
    url: '/contact',
  },
];
```

The Replexica Compiler will automatically infer the metadata from the JSX and prepare the text for translation.
