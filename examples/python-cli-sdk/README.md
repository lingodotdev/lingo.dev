# 🐍 Lingo.dev Python Example: CLI & SDK Integration

This example demonstrates the **full-stack localization workflow** for a Python application using the Lingo.dev platform. It showcases two primary use cases:

1.  **Static Content Translation (CLI):** Automating the translation of fixed application strings (like UI labels) stored in JSON files using the Lingo.dev CLI.
2.  **Dynamic Content Translation (SDK):** Translating user-generated or runtime content in real-time using the Lingo Python SDK within the application logic.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run this example, you need:

* **Node.js & npm/npx:** Required to run the Lingo.dev CLI tool.
* **Python 3.x:** Recommended version 3.8 or higher.
* **A Lingo.dev API Key:** You need an API key for both the CLI and the SDK to connect to the translation engine.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the example locally.

### 1. Setup

Clone the repository and navigate into the example directory:

```bash
# Assuming you are in the root of the Lingo.dev repository
cd examples/python-cli-sdk
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a file named **`.env`** in this directory and populate it with your API key. This is used by the `app.py` script for the SDK demonstration.

> **Note:** The `.env` file is intentionally excluded from Git and should not be committed for security.

```ini
# .env file content
LINGO_API_KEY="YOUR_LINGO_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Static Translation (CLI Workflow)

The `i18n.json` file is configured to translate the source file (`locales/en.json`) into Spanish (`es`) and French (`fr`).

Execute the Lingo.dev CLI to generate the translations:

```bash
npx lingo.dev run
```

This command will automatically create the translated files: `locales/es.json` and `locales/fr.json`.

### 5. Run the Application (SDK Workflow)

Execute the main Python script. It will first load the static content and then prompt you for text to translate dynamically via the SDK.

```bash
python app.py
```

#### Example Output:

The output will first show the English static strings, followed by the Spanish static strings (generated by the CLI), and then it will perform the real-time translation of your input using the SDK.
