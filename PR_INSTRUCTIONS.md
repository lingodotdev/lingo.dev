# 🚀 Add Complete OpenAI GPT Support

## Overview
This PR adds complete OpenAI GPT support to Lingo.dev, filling a critical gap in LLM provider support. OpenAI was listed in the config schema but not actually implemented - this fixes that missing functionality.

## ✅ What's Added
- **OpenAI SDK Integration** - Full GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo support
- **API Key Management** - Environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) and config-based key handling
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages with CI/CD detection
- **Provider Details** - Complete OpenAI provider configuration for troubleshooting
- **Demo & Documentation** - Working example with optimal settings

## 🎯 Impact
- Enables the most popular LLM provider (OpenAI GPT models)
- Supports GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo, and future OpenAI models
- Maintains consistency with existing provider patterns
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- Follows all project conventions and quality standards

## 📁 Files Modified

    "prompt": "Translate from {source} to {target}. Be accurate and natural.",

      "temperature": 0.3
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
