## Introduction

WARNING: Permanently delete translation entries from bucket path patterns defined in i18n.json. This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone. Without any filters, ALL managed keys will be removed from EVERY target locale.

## Usage

`lingo.dev purge [options]`

## Options

### `--bucket <bucket>`

```bash
lingo.dev purge --bucket <bucket>
```

Limit the purge to specific bucket types defined under \`buckets\` in i18n.json. Repeat the flag to include multiple bucket types. Defaults to all buckets

Takes value

### `--file [files...]`

```bash
lingo.dev purge --file [files...]
```

Filter which file paths to purge by matching against path patterns. Only paths containing any of these values will be processed. Examples: --file messages.json --file admin/

Optional value

### `--key <key>`

```bash
lingo.dev purge --key <key>
```

Filter which keys to delete using prefix matching on dot-separated key paths. Example: 'auth.login' matches all keys starting with auth.login. Omit this option to delete ALL keys. Keys marked as locked or ignored in i18n.json are automatically skipped

Takes value

### `--locale <locale>`

```bash
lingo.dev purge --locale <locale>
```

Limit purging to specific target locale codes from i18n.json. Repeat the flag to include multiple locales. Defaults to all configured target locales. Warning: Including the source locale will delete content from it as well.

Takes value

## Flags

### `--yes-really`

```bash
lingo.dev purge --yes-really
```

Bypass safety confirmations for destructive operations. Use with extreme caution - this will delete translation keys without asking for confirmation. Intended for automated scripts and CI environments only.
