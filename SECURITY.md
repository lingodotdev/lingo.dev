## Security Best Practices

When using Lingo.dev, follow these security best practices:

### API Keys
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Store API keys in environment variables or secure vaults
- Use `.env` files and add them to `.gitignore`
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### Configuration
- Review your `i18n.json` configuration for sensitive data
- Avoid including sensitive information in translation strings
- Use appropriate file permissions for configuration files

### Dependencies
- Keep Lingo.dev and its dependencies up to date
- Regularly run `pnpm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Review dependency updates before applying them

### CI/CD
- Secure your CI/CD secrets (e.g., `LINGODOTDEV_API_KEY`)
- Use GitHub's encrypted secrets for sensitive data
- Limit access to CI/CD configurations
- Review workflow permissions regularly

### LLM Provider Keys
When using LLM providers (Groq, Google, Mistral):
- Store provider API keys securely
- Never expose keys in client-side code
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Set up usage limits and alerts
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

## Known Security Considerations

### Translation Content
- Translations are processed by third-party LLM providers
- Avoid translating sensitive or confidential information
- Review translations before deploying to production
- Consider data residency requirements for your use case

### Network Security
- Lingo.dev makes API calls to LLM providers
- Ensure your network allows HTTPS connections
- Consider using a proxy for additional security
- Monitor outbound API traffic

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Updates are announced through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Discord announcements
- Email notifications (for critical issues)

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Lingo.dev CLI (`packages/cli`)
- Lingo.dev Compiler (`packages/compiler`)
- Lingo.dev SDK (`packages/sdk`)
- Lingo.dev React package (`packages/react`)
- CI/CD integrations
- Official documentation and examples

## Out of Scope

- Third-party LLM provider vulnerabilities (report to the provider)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues in outdated versions

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a paid bug bounty program, but we deeply appreciate security researchers who help keep Lingo.dev secure. We will:

- Publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission)
- Credit you in our security advisories
- Provide swag or recognition for significant findings
