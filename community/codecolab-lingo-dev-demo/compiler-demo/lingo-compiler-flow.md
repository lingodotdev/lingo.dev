# Lingo.dev Compiler Demo

This demo includes an opt-in localization compiler feature.

When triggered:
1. Static UI files are scanned
2. User-facing strings are extracted
3. Translation keys are generated
4. Locale JSON files are produced

In a production setup, this workflow would be
powered by the Lingo.dev compiler or CLI.

The demo intentionally keeps this process explicit
to maintain developer trust and control.
