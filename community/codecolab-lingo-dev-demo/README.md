# CodeColab × Lingo.dev

A demo project showing how a real-time collaborative coding platform
can integrate Lingo.dev to support internationalization (i18n) and
AI-powered localization workflows.

This repository is a **showcase**, not the full CodeColab source code.

## 🔍 What This Demo Shows

This demo focuses on two key features:

1. **Runtime Language Switching**
   - UI text updates instantly based on selected language
   - Implemented using React i18n with JSON locale files

2. **Opt-in Localization Compiler (Lingo.dev)**
   - Developers can choose to convert static UI strings into i18n resources
   - Demonstrates how Lingo.dev can act as a localization compiler
   - Conversion is explicit, safe, and developer-controlled

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Collaborative developer tools are used globally, but localization is
often an afterthought.

This demo shows how localization can be:
- Built into the developer workflow
- Optional and non-intrusive
- Powered by AI using Lingo.dev
