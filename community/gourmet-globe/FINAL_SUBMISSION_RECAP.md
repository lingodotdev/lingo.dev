# GourmetGlobe - Final Submission Recap 🌍🍲

## 🚀 Enhancements & Fixes

To ensure GourmetGlobe stands out as a premium, functional, and fully-localized platform, the following sub-tasks have been completed:

### 1. **Premium UI/UX Overhaul**

- **3D Interactive Globe**: Integrated a high-performance 3D globe using `cobe` with markers for all 6 supported locales (EN, HI, JA, FR, ES, AR).
- **Aurora Typography**: Enhanced the hero section with dynamic `AuroraText` animations.
- **Improved Layout**: Added `lucide-react` icons and a responsive grid that feels like a real recipe platform.

### 2. **Multi-lingual Excellence**

- **Expanded Dictionaries**: Added complex keys for recipes including `prep_time`, `cook_time`, and `difficulty` to provide more depth for the localization demo.
- **Manual Localization**: Hand-crafted 5 locale files (`hi.json`, `ja.json`, `fr.json`, `es.json`, `ar.json`) to demonstrate Lingo.dev's multi-lingual power in the absence of API-triggered translations.

### 3. **Code Cleanup & Architecture**

- **Removed Template Leftovers**: Cleaned up all references to "Tambo", "Autumn", and "Firecrawl" from `.env.example`, `utils.ts`, and project dictionaries.
- **Tailwind 4 Ready**: Robustified `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` to ensure a consistent design system.
- **Refactored Components**: Improved `Section` and `Layout` components for better reusability and accessibility.

### 4. **Addressed AI Review Feedback**

- Resolved warnings about incomplete Tailwind configuration.
- Removed unused database connection logic and legacy auth placeholders that were flagged as problematic.
