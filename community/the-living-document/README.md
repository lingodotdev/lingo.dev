## 💎 Highlighting Lingo.dev Features

The Living Document is more than just an editor, it's a demonstration of how **Lingo.dev** revolutionizes internationalization:

1.  **Dynamic Contextualization:** Unlike traditional i18n keys, Lingo.dev-powered workflows (like this app) use LLMs to translate entire blocks of text while maintaining global context.
2.  **Real-Time i18n:** Shows how translation can be moved from a "build-time" or "manual" process to a "runtime" user experience.
3.  **Adaptive Locale Management:** Demonstrates the ability to handle arbitrary custom locales beyond a static list of `en`, `es`, `fr`.
4.  **Preservation of Technical Terms:** Highlights the system prompt strategy to keep code snippets and technical jargon untranslated - a core requirement for modern dev-tools.
